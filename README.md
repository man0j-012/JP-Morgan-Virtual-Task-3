.P. Morgan Virtual Experience Task 3
Project Overview
This project is a web application developed as part of the J.P. Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience. The goal of Task 3 is to create a real-time data visualization tool that assists traders by providing live updates on market data. The application displays various metrics in a clear and interactive format, enabling users to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

Features

Live Data Feed Integration: Real-time updates on stock prices and other financial metrics.
Dynamic Visualizations: Line charts, candlestick charts, and bar graphs to represent data effectively.
User Interaction: Tooltips, filtering options, and zoom capabilities for better data analysis.
Error Handling: Smooth error handling for stable performance, even with data feed interruptions.

Tech Stack and Skills Used

Frontend
JavaScript: Core logic for data processing and visualization.
HTML & CSS: Structuring and styling of the web application.
React.js: Framework for building the user interface.
D3.js / Chart.js / Plotly: Libraries for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.

Backend
Node.js: Server-side logic for handling data requests (if applicable).
Express.js: Web framework for setting up routes and endpoints (if applicable).

Data Handling
